# My Fork

This repository is a fork of [Alexander Nabokikh's nix config](https://github.com/AlexNabokikh/nix-config)

I've forked this repository and made a configuration that I'm quite happy with, however I would not suggest that you build your configuration on top of mine, please visit the original which has a detailed and intuitive (might I add amazing) explanation on how to modify it to fit your needs.
